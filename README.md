## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered Travel Planner Agent designed to automate and personalize the travel planning process. The agent creates detailed, day-wise itineraries tailored to user preferences such as destination, budget, group size, and specific interests—reducing the manual effort involved in travel preparation.

Developed as part of an internship, the project leverages IBM Cloud Lite services and advanced AI models. All documentation and results are presented in the provided PDF, PPT, and Jupyter notebook files.
